# AI-Based Medical Diagnosis System

## 🌟 Overview
The **AI-Based Medical Diagnosis System** is a machine learning-powered application that assists in the early detection of multiple diseases, including:
- **Heart Disease**
- **Lung Cancer**
- **Thyroid Disorders**
- **Parkinson's Disease**

This system utilizes **Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest** for accurate predictions. The application is built using **Python** and provides an interactive UI via **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Multi-Disease Diagnosis (Heart, Lung Cancer, Thyroid, Parkinson's)  
✅ Uses **SVM, Logistic & Linear Regression, Random Forest**  
✅ **Streamlit**-powered interactive UI  
✅ User-friendly input form for diagnosis  
✅ **Real-time Predictions** based on user input  
✅ Trained on medical datasets for accurate results

## 📊 Model Training & Usage
1. **Dataset Preprocessing**
   - Load datasets using `pandas`
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize data using `StandardScaler`
   
2. **Train Models**
   - `SVM` for Parkinson's Disease
   - `Random Forest` for Lung Cancer Detection
   - `Logistic Regression` for Heart Disease
   - `Linear Regression` for Thyroid Detection
   
3. **Model Saving & Deployment**
   - Trained models are saved using `pickle`
   - The models are loaded in `app.py` for real-time predictions
